# dirindex-gallery

This is an angular2 app which dinamically generates a browseable
image gallery, reading nginx dirindex data.

I wrote this to be able to serve my personal photo library from a
low power A20-OLinuXino-MICRO-4GB board, which wasn't able to run a
server-side interactive application at a decent speed.
